# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working on this Node.js TypeScript CLI.

## Core rules

1. Fail fast. Propagate errors as typed `Error` subclasses and map them to exit codes only in the CLI layer.
2. Never add silent defaults for missing arguments, files, or configuration. Required inputs stay required and produce a usage error.
3. Never suppress checks with `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, lint-disable comments, coverage ignores, Stryker or ts-archunit exclusion comments, or skipped tests.
4. Never run a shell from the CLI. Use `execFile`, `spawn`, or their sync variants with an argument array; `exec`, `execSync`, and `shell: true` are forbidden.
5. Use npm and the checked-in scripts exclusively. Do not introduce another package manager.
6. Preserve ES modules and `.js` extensions in relative TypeScript imports.
7. Add no dependency when Node.js, TypeScript, or an existing dependency already solves the problem.
8. Every check runs locally from the repository. Do not add containers, hosted services, or checks that need live network data.

## Architecture

The dependency direction is:

```text
index.ts -> cli/* -> application/* -> domain/*
lib.ts   -> application/*, domain/*
```

- `index.ts` is the executable entrypoint: it wires process streams and sets the exit code, nothing else.
- `lib.ts` is the public programmatic API and the only module `exports` points at.
- `cli/` owns argument parsing, input/output streams, usage text, and exit codes.
- `application/` owns use cases that turn raw input into domain calls.
- `domain/` owns pure business behavior: no file system, processes, environment, or network.
- dependency-cruiser enforces import direction; ts-archunit enforces what happens inside function bodies (typed errors only, no `process.env` in inner layers, no eval, no stubs).
- Do not add command frameworks, dependency-injection containers, base classes, or plugin registries without a demonstrated need.

## CLI behavior

- Exit `0` on success, `1` on runtime failure, `2` on usage errors. Usage errors print the usage text to stderr.
- Results go to stdout; diagnostics go to stderr. Keep stdout machine-readable.
- Read `-` as stdin. Never guess a source when none is given.

## Verification

- Test the domain and application layers directly with Vitest.
- Cover invariants with fast-check property tests, and the public TypeScript contract with `test/types/*.test-d.ts`.
- Test the built CLI as a black box through `child_process` (exit codes, stdout, stderr).
- Test the packed artifact (`npm pack`) so what ships is what was tested.
- Keep coverage at or above 80% and the mutation score at or above 80%.
- Run `just ci` before committing. Fix every finding instead of suppressing it.

## Justfile conventions

- Use `printf` for colored or formatted output.
- Keep a blank output line before and after command blocks.
- Keep the dedicated, manually grouped `help` recipe current.
- Every recipe must fail fast and end with a clear status message.
